I wish I was able to start early on this project. I had setbacks in my life that kept me from starting earlier. I would've added a lot more to what I have currently. Better late than never would apply here; however, if everything goes right with my submission, then I am not too late.
The page setup had me scared. I did it on Monday the 10th, and I thought it was progressing; however, by the end of Monday, I noticed that I had an error. It was caused by a subrepository that had an empty URL, which caused it to never make a page. Luckily, I found tutorials on how to get past it.

As for the HTML and JS, I found a video by the YouTuber named Brocode, where he went over a simple calculator app. My HTML code and parts of my JS code were influenced by this video. I also needed help with setting up the eventListener function to allow users to input equations into the display using the keyboard. I had to use ChatGPT for this implementation. I did not copy and paste; I studied off the code and improved on it

I had to look up how to find the last number, and thankfully, someone asked it on stackoverflow which influenced how I did the percentage function. 
Before the percentage function, I had trouble implementing the toggle function, so I thought about it, and I wanted to use the same logic from the percentage function, and made the final draft of the toggle function. It now works as intended, and it allows for multiplication and division to be done with a negative operand. 
As for the CSS, I based it on how the assignment 3 CSS was made. I did it all manually/no copying/pasting. If I had more time, I would like to make my calculator a bit more prettier lol. 
Just know professor, I did my best lol. Thank you for your time, and I hope you like my work and that it meets your standards.
