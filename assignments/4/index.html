        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Ethan M. Garcia. I am a student at San Francisco State University. I am 22 years old and I am very passionate about learning new things. When I was
             a kid, I would watch Animal Planet with my dad which got me into learning about reptiles and insects. My favorites would change like the seasons, my first favorite 
             lizard was the Gila Monster, then it switched to the Green Pit Viper, and if I were to list the rest, this webpage would look like an Obelisk full of venomous snakes and
             spiders. As I grew older, I realized that I worked well with computers. With the help of my mother, I developed my understanding of computers during middle school. 
             It began with us fixing an old laptop that my uncle gave us. We were able to reinstall the Windows OS and reconfigure the default language (Italian) into English. 
             From there, we took math courses seriously. My mother and I would watch Algebra II and Pre-Calc videos on youtube. I felt like I would be a great computer engineer. 
        </p>
        <p>After entering college, I found it a bit difficult to stay motivated to continue my major. There were a few professors that really made me want to quit this major however,
             Professors like Yash Gandhi, James Wong, Jeonghee Kim, and Duc Ta inspired me to continue on the path that I am on today. Continuing on, another Professor that inspired me 
             to expand my career horizons was professor Amedeo Simoncini. The class he taught was ENGR 610, "Engineering Cost Analysis", that class combinded the business aspect of engineering.
             I really enjoyed being in the class, which may be surprising since the entire grade was based on exams (3 total with the weight of each being 33%). It was MS Excel focused, which
             gave me a feeling of familiarity since my mother had a "Business-focused" career. It was a class that gave me some sort of purpose with major.  
             
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Calculator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My first assignment for CSC 413 (before I dropped it), I had to make a functional calculator app with javascript (I didn't know JS at the time :/)</li>
            <li>It was all coding based and the professor gave us a skeleton code to work off of</li>
            <li>The only good thing that came from my attempt was that I didn't brick my PC</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PCB Board</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A project of mine for my ENGR 301 class revolved around making device that takes in 
                audio and outputs that audio through a pair of headphones. The device's main body was a PCB board. We utilized the "Eagle" software offered by Autodesk</li>
            <li>It was first done virtually, however we needed to send our schematic to our professor so he can get them created. We also needed to purchase
                components like resistors, capacitors, and earphone input jacks. 
            </li>
            <li>I learned what went into board creation as well as learning how to solder components into said board. </li>
        </ul>
